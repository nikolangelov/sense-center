                The frieze carpet resembles the steps of the models, but its production uses twisted yarns, which are woven into an unevenly knit surface.

                It is best to purchase professional cleaning agents for your frieze carpet if you decide to take this step yourself. However, it is not worth it, because you will certainly not do as well as companies offering deep cleaning of carpets.

Despite the advantage of more difficult contamination of this type of carpet, deep cleaning is a must. However, the layered dirt worsens the appearance of the carpet and pollutes the cleanliness of the house.

                <strong>Regarding the vacuum cleaner for the carpet vacuuming, there are some basic characteristics that are good to meet:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>

                        <p><strong>It is recommended that the vacuum cleaner has a HEPA filter</strong> – it is used for better air purification, which provides a healthier living environment. Vacuum cleaners with a HEPA filter capture even the smallest particles of dirt.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p><strong>Higher power</strong> – despite difficult-to-see dirt, carpet fibers collect a lot of dirt that is difficult to remove in a vacuum with lower power.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p><strong>Easy manoeuvring</strong> – Garbage capacity doesn’t matter, but bet on a model that is more compact.

                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p><strong>Colour</strong> – this feature is the last, but as more and more people rely on the overall colour gamut of the home, many users are more specific about this requirement. The good thing is that you will hardly find it difficult to find the colour you are looking for because there is an abundance of shades.</p>
