                    You don’t need to be a medical professional in order to realize that allergies are among the most widespread health conditions nowadays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One study finds out that around 80% of allergy sufferers are over-sensitive to proteins found in the waste of dust mites. A single ounce of your carpet, on the other hand, can contain up to 2,000 dust mites if not regularly and properly sanitised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you let that information sink in, you will probably no longer wonder why your eyes itch, why your nose runs, and why you continuously experience a set of unusual symptoms when in a room with a carpet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, how can you stand up to carpet allergies, prevent and defeat them? Here is everything you need to know, in a nutshell.

                <p>
                    Carpets are soft, warm, cozy, and stylish. Still, they are also a real magnet for multiple allergens. Carpet fiber, industrial glue, mold, dust, animal dander, skin flakes, bacteria, pollen grains, secondary moisture, dust mites, and dust mite feces – this sounds like a vicious formula indeed, doesn’t it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carpet fibres can trap and retain allergens for a prolonged period, and vacuuming is not a universal solution. When neglecting the deep cleaning of your carpet every once in a while, you might start experiencing mild to intense discomfort manifested through:

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Severe and unattended symptoms might evolve and result in causing serious chronic conditions such as dermatitis, allergy-induced asthma, contact dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis. Babies, toddlers, senior citizens, and people with accompanying diseases are more prone to undergo various allergy symptoms – that’s why households with such inhabitants need to pay special attention to hygiene.

                <p>
                    Awful as they sound, carpet allergies are totally preventable. All you need to do is seek professional assistance at least every 12 to 18 months, while six months is the optimal period.

            <div class="mt-20 py-8 px-12 md-px-14 bg-paper b-rd-3" style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 5px rgb(84 89 95 / 18%);">
                <p>Regular vacuuming is undoubtedly essential. Home experts recommend thorough vacuuming to be performed twice a week for homes without pets and daily for homes with pets.</p>

                <p>However, vacuuming is simply not able to extract deep-seated dirt, dust mites, germs, and bacteria from the fibres of the carpet. In the best-case scenario, a powerful vacuum cleaner will collect the dust and dirt from the very surface of the rug, while other particles and allergens would remain hidden deep down its lower sections.</p>

                <p>As you may suggest, this won’t be much of a win against carpet allergies. Thankfully, steam carpet cleaning is a different piece of cake.</p>

                <p>Steam carpet cleaning, also called hot water extraction, is a game-changer for people prone to allergies and sensitivities. It is offered in two sub-options – conventional steam carpet cleaning and eco-friendly steam carpet cleaning – both of which can eliminate up to 99% of all allergens in your carpet.</p>

                <p>So, what do you need to know about steam carpet cleaning?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>It is <strong>the deepest rug, carpet, or upholstery cleaning method available</strong>. It reaches parts of the carpet otherwise unreachable even for the most powerful professional vacuum cleaners on the market.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>It <strong>sanitizes, kills bacteria, eliminates dust mites, deodorizes, and rejuvenates</strong> the carpet with a single procedure, lasting about 10 to 20 minutes per room.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>It <strong>leaves the carpet utterly refurbished and freed from all allergens</strong> – from dust and skin flakes to biologically active pollutants.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>It is <strong>quite affordable</strong>, with costs of approximately £15.00 for a medium rug, if cleaned by an NCCA (National Carpet Cleaners Association) certified professional.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Regularly steam cleaning the carpets, the upholstery, and even the drapery of your home and/or office will dramatically reduce the odds of developing a carpet allergy. Additional steps to consider in order to protect yourself against the allergens include buying a HEPA-certified vacuum cleaner, reducing the humidity in your residence, keeping windows shut throughout allergy season, or installing an air-cleansing system.</p>

                <p>Carpet allergies are a terrible thing to experience, and thankfully, a fully preventable one. As regular vacuuming is insufficient, steam carpet cleaning services step in to save the day. Steam carpet cleaning doesn’t take too long, doesn’t cost a fortune, and doesn’t require anything special on your part – all you need to do is care about yourself and let the professionals do the rest.</p>
