                    No stain is preferred, but in the case of a spill of milk on the carpet, you can even call yourself lucky. The dirt is white in color and one of the easiest to clean. Usually this is one of the few times when the hosts do not become terrified but retain their composure. However, the white spots should not be neglected and left for later cleaning, as the deterioration of the carpet appearance comes after the spots are slightly withered and faded and become less pleasant.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
