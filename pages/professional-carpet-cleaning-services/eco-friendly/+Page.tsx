        <Typography variant="body">Yes, we request that our clients make provisions for suitable parking spaces in close proximity to the property. In cases where parking or congestion charges are incurred, the client is kindly asked to bear the associated costs if possible.</Typography></li>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="h3">3. Do I need to move my furniture before the carpet cleaning eco services?</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">We kindly request your cooperation in relocating small, delicate, or valuable furniture items, such as lamps and ornaments, before the performance of our natural carpet cleaning services. This is primarily for insurance purposes. If possible, we recommend positioning these items in a secure area that won't be affected during the green carpet cleaning process. We are more than willing to assist in moving other lightweight furniture items, such as chairs, armchairs, and tables during the cleaning. Once the cleaning is completed, we will ensure these items are returned to their original positions. However, if there is a need to move heavy furniture items like sofas, beds, wardrobes, and cupboards, please be aware that an additional charge will be applied. This extra fee accounts for the additional time and effort required by our technician, who will be appropriately compensated. Our primary objective is to ensure a stress-free experience for you throughout the entire ecology carpet cleaning process.</Typography></li>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="h3">4. What if I live on the 4th floor and have no lift?</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">Due to the substantial weight of our equipment for the bio-clean carpet cleaning, which exceeds 50 kilograms, an additional fee is applied for each additional floor that requires manual transportation. This is necessary because manually carrying the heavy equipment up multiple flights of stairs is a time-consuming task, and it can cause our technicians to fatigue more quickly. Consequently, our overall productivity for the day may be reduced compared to our standard output.</Typography></li>

      <li>
        <Typography variant="h3">7. How long does the process of eco-organic carpet cleaning take?</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">The organic carpet cleaning needs more agitation and more manual work than the traditional carpet cleaning. So it takes more time and in some cases may need a second cleaning. We do not guarantee that the stain will be removed, as the sustainable cleaners are not as efficient as the conventional ones.</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">However, the time it takes for the eco pro carpet cleaning process primarily hinges on these factors:</Typography></li>
      <ul class="ml--5" style="list-style: initial;">
        <Typography variant="li">
          <p>The level of soiling on the carpet;</p>

      </ul>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="h3">8. How long does it take for the carpet to get dry after environmentally friendly carpet cleaning services?</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">The drying time of the carpet after a carpet cleaning without chemicals varies depending on the carpet type and the cleaning method employed. For instance, when the eco steam carpet cleaning method is utilised, the approximate drying time typically ranges from 7 to 9 hours. On the other hand, if the green dry carpet cleaning method is chosen, the carpet will be dry immediately after the cleaning process or shortly thereafter.</Typography>

        <Typography variant="body">Unfortunately, we are unable to provide an absolute guarantee due to several factors, which include:</Typography></li>

Over these years, we've dealt with a wide variety of carpets, rugs, upholstery, and various stains from both commercial and residential clients.

        <Typography variant="h3">16. Can you give me a discount for the organic carpet cleaning services?</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">Our natural carpet cleaning company’s services are widely recognised for their exceptional quality, use of the most efficient equipment, and a selection of over 20 premium cleaning products. Consequently, our healthy carpet cleaning prices stand out not only for their competitiveness but also for their attractiveness within the market. We highly recommend combining all essential services for your specific eco-green carpet cleaning needs. You'll promptly notice that bundling all the services you require is notably more cost-effective compared to having them performed individually. This cost-effectiveness is due to the initial higher eco-clean carpet cost, in addition to the charges related to each technician visit, which factor in elements like travel time, parking, and the handling of heavy equipment during loading and unloading.</Typography></li>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="h3">17. Are carpet cleaning chemicals safe?</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">The safety of carpet cleaning chemicals can vary depending on the specific products used. Generally, most carpet cleaning solutions are designed to be safe for use when handled properly, but we advise you to be aware of a few factors, such as:</Typography></li>
      <ul class="ml--5" style="list-style: initial;">
        <Typography variant="li">
          <p>The chemical composition of the detergents being used;</p>
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="li">
          <p>The proper application of the product;</p>
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="li">
          <p>If there’s any residue left behind after the cleaning;</p>
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="li">
          <p>The environmental impact of the chemicals used.</p>
        </Typography>
      </ul>
      <Typography variant="body">Hiring professional green carpet cleaning companies, such as “Fine Carpet Cleaning” Ltd. will ensure you that your carpets will be handled excellently. Experts are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and utilise advanced equipment that can more effectively remove residues. If you have specific health concerns or sensitivities, we recommend booking eco-friendly carpet cleaning services. This service will provide a quality cleaning of your carpet, as well as a chemical-free carpet cleaning.</Typography>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="h3">18. What is eco-friendly carpet cleaning?</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">Eco-friendly carpet cleaning, also known as green carpet cleaning, refers to a carpet cleaning process that prioritises environmental sustainability and the safety of humans and pets. This approach involves the use of cleaning methods, products, and equipment that have minimal impact on the environment.</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">The eco-friendly carpet cleaning solution is made entirely of natural plant-based components that come from sustainable sources. It is completely biodegradable and has antibacterial and antiviral qualities due to its unique natural molecular cleansing activity. Imagine thousands of tiny hammers attacking the soiled carpet. When we spray the cleaner, the tiny, invisible particles help break down the soil and the viruses for you. Visible and enhanced benefits will continue even after extraction. We use these cleaners for cleaning carpets and sofas. This cleaning method needs more agitation, more manual work and may need a second cleaning. There is no guarantee that the stain will be removed as they are not as efficient as the traditional ones.</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">When considering carpet cleaning eco-services, it's essential to choose an environmentally friendly carpet cleaning services provider that adheres to these principles and standards to help protect your home, your health, and the environment.</Typography>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="h3">19. Can you walk on the carpet after a bio-clean carpet cleaning?</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">It depends on the method used. After an eco steam carpet cleaning, it is recommended that you try to stay off the freshly cleaned carpets until they are dry – about 7-9 hours. If you can not avoid walking over the carpet before it is dry, do it with caution. When from the carpet you step on a hard surface, like tile or hardwood, it can be very slippery.</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">If a green dry carpet cleaning method has been applied, the carpet or rug will be completely dry immediately after or shortly thereafter the eco pro carpet cleaning has ended.</Typography>

      <li>
        <Typography variant="h3">20. How often should carpets go through carpet cleaning without chemicals?</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">Cleaning by green carpet cleaning companies depends mainly on factors like how fast the carpet or rug soils. On average, a carpet should be cleaned at 12-month intervals. However, if you have pets, children or high traffic on the carpet or if it is easily stained, we recommend using no chemicals carpet cleaning services more often than that. You can contact us anytime to get nontoxic carpet cleaning or just to seek professional advice.</Typography></li>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="h3">21. Does ecology carpet cleaning remove stains?</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">It depends on the eco-green carpet cleaning method being used. Eco steam carpet cleaning is highly proficient at eradicating deep-seated stains, dirt, and grime. It excels at eliminating bacteria, dust mites, allergens, mould, pet dander, and unpleasant odours. However, it's important to note that particularly stubborn stains, such as those that are very old or have been treated improperly, can present a significant challenge for complete removal, even with professional eco-clean carpet assistance.</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">On the other hand, green dry carpet cleaning is not as effective at stain removal, but it excels at refreshing the carpet's appearance and restoring its colour. This method is typically used for cleaning more delicate and natural carpets and rugs that are susceptible to water damage.</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">While we, at "Fine Carpet Cleaning Ltd.," have achieved impressive success rates in stain removal thanks to our extensive experience and the use of high-quality equipment, we cannot provide an absolute guarantee that every stain can be entirely eliminated. However, we want to assure you that we will assess each stain and provide information on whether we can successfully remove them during the quotation process. Your confidence in stain removal is our priority.</Typography></li>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="h3">22. How often should carpets go through eco-organic carpet cleaning with pets?</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">We recommend that pet owners seek eco carpet cleaning in London at least twice per year. If you are not sure whether your carpets, rugs or upholstery should go through green carpet cleaning services feel free to contact us at any suitable for you time to get professional advice.</Typography></li>
