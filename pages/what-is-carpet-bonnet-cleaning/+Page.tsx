                    The home, villa, office and commercial premises are in constant need of cleaning. It’s nice if you have a housemaid, but in case you can’t afford such a service, then you could take advantage of some individual ones. For example, cleaning windows, bathrooms, kitchen appliances, deep carpet cleaning, bonnet cleaning and more. Most of the activities are probably familiar to you, but do you know what the bonnet cleaning process means for carpets. When and what technology is applied? How long does it take? Is the process effective?

                    Bonnet cleaning is an intermediate cleaning of the accumulated dirt – between the ordinary vacuum and the deep cleaning. The procedure is a bit like precision hygiene, but has a different application. Again, a hot water machine and shampoo are used, but the removal of dirt is not as effective. The reason is that it is used rather for a cosmetic procedure that aims to clean the surface of the fibres. This keeps the carpet looking good for longer, but does not have the ability to remove stains that have penetrated deep into the mat. The advantage of Bonnet cleaning is that it is applicable everywhere – in sports centres, in cosmetic studios, with retail outlets, in the office, at home, etc. In addition, the machine uses times less water to remove dust particles and loosen up other contaminants – by circulating. And moisture is one of the factors that can cause the pad to rot and the smell of mould to appear.

            <div class="mt-20 py-8 px-8 md-px-14 bg-paper b-rd-3" style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 5px rgb(84 89 95 / 18%);">
                <h3>Step 1: Assemble the machine</h3>
                <p>
                    Good preparation will facilitate you in the cleaning process further. What you need to do is actually attach the bonnet to the machine pad. How could you do it the easiest way? Just put the special equipment lying down. This will allow you to attach a so-called swab that will act as a surface hygienic pads. Make sure everything is properly secured before you begin the procedure. The machine also allows attachments to other pads – some softer brushes that are more suitable for treating some woven carpets.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 2: Prepare the area for bonnet cleaning</h3>
                <p>
                    Clean the ground well – remove small and large objects that can be pushed, broken, or just stumble when you focus on technology. Such preparation is recommended for any cleaning – bonnet, deeply steam-cleaned, “dry treatment” of the tissue. It greatly facilitates those who will undertake the responsible task of home hygiene. Once you have cleared the terrain well enough of furniture, toys, home slippers, fragile items, etc. it is time to apply a vacuum. It is good to be made with a more powerful vacuum cleaner, running consistently through long lines from one end to the other.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 3: Apply the cleaning with the bonnet machine</h3>
                <p>
                    Take a look at the user guide and follow strictly the steps outlined there. Sometimes consumers criticize appliances, but they don’t really know how to use them effectively. So you need to be prepared with the knowledge to put it into practice. You could rent equipment or buy one to always have on hand. You should now plug the machine into the socket and have a clear picture of the consistent treatment of the area on the carpet. Keep the freewheeling cable behind it so that it does not bend or step when moving back and forward. The correct posture for manoeuvring is with a stance and a lean handle to your stomach. This will give you the right balance, convenience and ease of sliding across the floor. If you turn left or right, there are tricks to turn it in the desired direction. With a slight lift of the handle, it will point to the right and, when pressed down, to the left. Tissue treatment is a key point in the type of pad and filaments.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 4: Rinse the carpet</h3>
                <p>
                    After the previous step of the carpet is completed, the dirt should already be removed. Despite the significant improvement of the species, rinsing is required. The machine is again used for this purpose, but the water must be replaced with clean water. Empty the tank with dirty water and refill it. This process will lead to complete hygiene and elimination of the presence of harmful chemicals and residues from other cleaning agents. When rinsing the area occupied by the carpet, it is advisable to wear overshoes. This is a preventative measure against its re-contamination while still moist. After rinsing, the soft flooring should be allowed to dry well. This is the final stage of cleaning, good results should already be seen.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 5: Clean the machine elements</h3>
                <p>
                    After taking care of the carpet, you should do the same for the assistant. It is important to disassemble all the components that separate. Wash those that will not be damaged by direct contact with water. You can clean them separately or together in a larger container of clean water. Then dry them well and only then dry the whole composition. Be sure to dispose of available water and detergent from the tank so that they do not contaminate the surface the next time you refresh. Storage of the machine is important – the more you take care of it, the longer you can use it. Such an investment is worth it, so consider buying rather than renting.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 6: Arrange the room again</h3>
                <p>
                    It’s time to enjoy the beautiful and clean view that was created with your help. You can now safely return all furniture and objects back to their seats. For the more severe, ask for help from family and friends. Do not do this task yourself, teamwork is always better done and takes less time. With this latest arrangement, you have the opportunity to put a little creativity and make a slight change in the interior. The whole family will feel even more comfortable and you will get twice the satisfaction of the job.
