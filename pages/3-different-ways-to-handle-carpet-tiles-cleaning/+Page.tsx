            <div class="mt-20 py-8 px-8 md-px-14 bg-paper b-rd-3" style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 5px rgb(84 89 95 / 18%);">

                <p>
                    In your everyday life, you shall perform regular vacuuming at least once a week to ensure decent overall hygiene for your home and your carpet tiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most types of carpet tiles can also be rinsed in a sink. To do so, you should reassemble the tiling and rinse each part separately, using a mild detergent and your bare hands. If you prefer to use a brush, make sure it is really soft and do not push too hard, as you can damage the fibers if you are trying too hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is always wise to check the manufacturer’s recommendations for rinsing the tiles and see if this approach is suitable for your product.

            <div class="mt-20 py-8 px-12 md-px-14 bg-paper b-rd-3" style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 5px rgb(84 89 95 / 18%);">

                <p>Trapped dry particles and biological contaminants can make your carpet tiles lose their initial shine and produce hazards to your health. Here is why most manufacturers suggest that carpet tiling shall be professionally cleaned every 8-12 months, or else said – at least once every year.</p>

                <p>When reaching out to an experienced service provider, they will inspect your carpet tiling and advise you on the most appropriate way to handle the task. Generally speaking, there is one general principle: nylon and polyester tiles can safely undergo hot water extraction or steam cleaning. At the same time, wool tiling is safer to be treated with dry carpet cleaning.</p>

                <p>If you have any doubts or reasons to prefer doing everything by yourself, you can always rent professional equipment and do the magic for your tiles.</p>

                <p>If you use professional rental machinery, always check the instructions, and follow them strictly. Keep in mind that hiring a professional is way safer for your carpet tiling, especially if you have zero experience until now.</p>

                <p>Choosing between those three approaches is individual and can depend on various criteria such as the current tiling condition, additional staining, your budget, and your personal preferences.</p>
