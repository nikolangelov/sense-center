            <h2 class="line-height-12 md-line-height-14">Is there any danger of vinegar staining your carpet?</h2>
            <div class="mt-20 py-8 px-8 md-px-14 bg-paper b-rd-3" style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 5px rgb(84 89 95 / 18%);">
                <p>
                    Although vinegar has been known for many years for its wide application – (used to clean up various contaminants), you should never trust it completely. Don’t risk damaging your furniture, carpets, car upholstery, etc. There is no way to be convinced that the fabric will not react in an unpleasant way and that the appearance and condition of the carpet will deteriorate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Therefore, the rule is one thing and one must always be observed – testing a part of the carpet that is not exposed directly (under the furniture or at one end). The easiest way is to wet a cloth with vinegar and rub a small area. To be sure it will not damage the surface, wait until you see the result for at least 24 hours. Despite proven time efficiency, there is little chance of damage to the paint.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then be sure to follow the instructions carefully while cleaning the carpet!

            <h2 class="line-height-12 md-line-height-14">The process of cleaning your carpet with white vinegar</h2>
            <div class="mt-20 py-8 px-8 md-px-14 bg-paper b-rd-3" style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 5px rgb(84 89 95 / 18%);">
                <p>
                    If you decide to apply a carpet cleaning with a white appraisal, open this manual and follow each step carefully and consistently:
                </p>
                <h3>Step 1: Vacuum</h3>
                <p>
                    You must prepare the surface thoroughly before starting with any be a cleaning method. This does not exclude the use of known white vinegar. First, a good vacuum must be applied to the entire surface in order to avoid dust. Keep in mind that if you pour any detergent on a dusty carpet, it means that it creates a prerequisite for even more color.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Get a precise vacuum cleaner from both the front and back – vacuum in all directions (length and width). Make sure you completely remove any dust particles and other easily removable dirt – only then start stain removal.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 2: Make a solution with vinegar</h3>
                <p>
                    Now is the time to make the main cleaning agent for your beautiful accessory. To do this you need to make the right amount of solution. This does not mean that the ingredients are too limited, because you will not be able to handle the cleaning successfully, or pour large doses and break the pad. So, do not neglect this activity because it is not insignificant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All you need to have is a pan (bucket, pan or other) to prepare the preparation, a few drops of soft soap, warm water and 3-4 cups of white vinegar. This should be a harmless solution, but always test a small and hidden part of the carpet to avoid damage (shrinkage, coloring, etc.)
                </p>
                <h3>Step 3: Begin with a substantial cleaning of the carpet</h3>
                <p>
                    Take a soft sponge or a clean white cloth to get started with rubbing dirt, visible spots and eliminating odors. In addition to its good hygienic action, white vinegar is also known for its incredible ability to absorb bad odors. Now you should dip the sponge (towel) in the solution and treat the area carefully – stick to straight and consistent movements. If you are cleaning the entire surface, start from one end to the other – you may need to repeat the process several times to achieve the desired results.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 4: Rinse the carpet</h3>
                <p>
                    Rinse is one of the final stages of cleaning, but it must be done very carefully. Here is the point where you need to eliminate the residual solution you have cleaned. If left on the carpet, it can lead to unpleasant yellowish shades that will aggravate the look of the carpet, which means that you have worked so hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rinse with plenty of cold water and you can easily use a hose or sprayer for a lighter jet. However, keep in mind that this activity is not appropriate if your carpet does not like excessive humidity. You need to know the fabric well and what you can do and don’t do with it. If you are unable to go outside, you can rinse it indoors with a clean cloth and clean water. The movement is the same as that applied to rub with the preparation.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 5: Removing excess moisture</h3>
                <p>
                    Most tissues do not tolerate being excessively moistened because the pad may break. This is why professionals use powerful suction machines after deep cleaning. If you don’t have something like this, you could use some other tricks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One option is to put it in a place where it can dry quickly – hang it. However, this can cause it to break, so you have to be careful where you hang it. Another option is to use the famous window cleaner to remove any water after rinsing. It may take a long time, but it will certainly prevent the pad from falling apart or getting a bad odor – mold, mildew, etc.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 6: Drying the carpet
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Drying can take place outside or in your home. Drying outside will be much faster, especially if it is warm and sunny. However, sometimes the sun’s rays can be dangerous for the floor, so care must be taken. In the event that the carpet dries in your home, you can speed up the process with the flow, turning on fans and humidifiers. It is an important condition that you do not step on the carpet until it is completely dry – best in about 24 hours to ensure that you have completed your mission successfully.
