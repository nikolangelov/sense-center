            <h2 class="line-height-12 md-line-height-14">Is steam carpet cleaning enough to do the trick?</h2>
            <div class="mt-20 py-8 px-12 md-px-14 bg-paper b-rd-3" style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 5px rgb(84 89 95 / 18%);">
                <p>The answer to this question is both yes and no. Steam carpet cleaning is proven to be the deepest and most effective method for maintaining perfect carpet hygiene. It kills over 99% of the bacteria and biologically active microorganisms that cause dog smell to linger in the air.</p>

                <p>Anyway, hot water extraction is rarely enough to give you the “wow” effect you’ve been hoping for. For an impeccable final result, steam carpet cleaning needs to be combined with the proper high-end cleaning solutions suitable for your carpet.</p>

                <p>The combination of chemical and mechanical cleaning will, therefore, guarantee a super-effective and long-lasting dog smell removal.</p>
