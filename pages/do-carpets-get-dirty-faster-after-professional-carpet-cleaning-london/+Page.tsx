                    We’d love to say that faster dirt accumulation on carpets after cleaning is a hollow and ridiculous myth. Anyway, many people had reportedly experienced such issues, and we are here to explain why.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Long story short: if the proper people clean your carpet by using the appropriate methods and equipment, dirt accumulation won’t speed up by the second. Anyway, certain mistakes can be made by inexperienced carpet cleaners that can actually result in accelerated soil build-up in the fibres of the carpet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, how is that issue preventable?

                <p>
                    Yes, it would be best if you vacuum your floor coverings before having them cleaned by a professional. Of course, most of the leading carpet cleaning companies around London can do that for you upon request.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vacuuming will remove dry soil particles and enhance the results of the professional carpet cleaners.

            <div class="mt-20 py-8 px-12 md-px-14 bg-paper b-rd-3" style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 5px rgb(84 89 95 / 18%);">
                <p>Oily stains and greasy build-ups have the power to attract and keep the dirt for amazingly long periods of time. Using poor-quality detergents and/or equipment can swipe away dirt layers without ever removing the oils. This will, logically, result in almost an instant dirt build-up once the cleaning is done.</p>

                <p>So, it is vital for carpet cleaners to engage in deep and effective oil removal by properly using the precise detergents.</p>

                <p>Expert recommendations say that the cleaning detergent needs to be sprayed on the carpet before the steam cleaning process begins. Pouring the detergent into the steam cleaning solution can make it stick deep in the fibres, resulting in rapid residue accumulation.</p>

                <p>What can you do about it? Make an informed decision and ask the right question before booking a visit from a carpet cleaning London company.</p>

            <div class="mt-20 py-8 px-8 md-px-14 bg-paper b-rd-3" style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 5px rgb(84 89 95 / 18%);">
                <p>If any detergents or cleaning solutions remain on the surface or deep inside your carpet, they will inevitably cause it to get dirty faster afterwards. The logic is pretty simple – soaps are sticky so that they could attract dirt. Anyway, if not adequately rinsed, their sticky residue will just… Well, keep attracting dirt.</p>

                <p>Also, keeping yourself, your pets, or your belongings away from the carpet surface is essential until it gets completely dry. After the professional carpet cleaning session is done, any client will be thoroughly advised on the drying time needed for their carpeting size and type.</p>

                <p>This being said, we can draw an easy conclusion – carpets won’t get dirty faster after cleaning. At least not if the cleaning is done by qualified experts.</p>
