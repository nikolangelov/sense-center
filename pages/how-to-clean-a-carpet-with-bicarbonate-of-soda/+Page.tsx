                    These impurities include spills of any kind of liquids that leave an unpleasant hue on the carpet. Most often, these are wine, juice, coffee, tea, beer, and more. To deal successfully with them, follow the instructions in sequence:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>“Powdered spot” – that means plenty sprinkling on it with soda bread to cover it completely.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>Pour a small amount of hot water on the stain.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>Then leave the mixture to work for a few hours. It is recommended even overnight. This method is extremely suitable for late night application before bedtime.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>The last step requires a precise vacuum on the treated area and then on the entire area of the carpet. You should already be happy with the result – the stain is gone and the shades are saturated and fresher again. In case of dissatisfaction, repeat the same steps again.</p>
                    </li>

                    There is a little more difficulty with cleaning here as the fat is more stubborn. You can probably guess what pollution is involved here – grease, fried foods, oil, olive oil and more. The approach here is a little different, but easy to apply:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>Initially, pick up a clean cloth or cloth and start carefully picking the grease. However, there is one very important rule – moving it from the inside to the inside, not rubbing and pressing, because the fat will go deeper into the fibers.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>Then sprinkle the baking soda on the stain again and let it work longer – also for about one night. The purpose is to allow the home cleaner more time to absorb as much of the floor grease as possible in the morning.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>You can try another trick – apply a little crease on the stain and rub gently.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>Then moisten a white clean cloth with some water to rinse the soapy carpet. Again, simply smudge, not rub, especially in the surroundings, to avoid smudging or dirt into the depth.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>After doing all this, dry the carpet.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml--5">
                        <p>Then you can sprinkle soda again and apply vacuum in about 3-4 hours for a better result. It is important to remain satisfied with the appearance of the carpet.</p>
                    </li>
